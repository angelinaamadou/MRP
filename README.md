<h2 align="center">GEOSPATIAL SIMULATION AND MODELLING OF OUT-OF-HOME ADVERTISING VIEWING OPPORTUNITY</h2>


Companies use out-of-home (OOH) advertising to promote their products. The purpose of the project is to build an integrated multi-source simulation model that allows Environics Analytics to establish optimal locations for marketing campaigns. 
The study area is located in the province of Manitoba in Canada. It concerns mainly the Winnipeg Metropolitan Area, which includes the city of Winnipeg and its surrounding municipalities. Using Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths, 
a simulation algorithm will be developed.  The top ten busiest intersections are retrieved and used as recommended locations for out-of-home (OOH) advertising.  
Additionally, a Wilcoxon signed rank test is used to validate the simulation output against empirical data. In general, there is no statistically significant 
difference between the simulated data and the empirical set.  The study has shown that multi-agent-based models, although in their infancy, represent a viable approach to modelling population dynamic.   
Results from the simulation can be used to develop a new model which may include demographic profiles of the population for further studies.
